# Objective

Depression is sustained by repeated recalls of memories of the bad events.  One solution that sometimes works is to change environments. Even if one doesn’t know what the retrieval cues are, they know they can somehow be embedded in the current environment and lifestyle. Our objective is to help people turn off depression triggers by giving them an environment where they can relax, talk, and exercise.
