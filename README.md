# Objective

Triloka blends the three realms of the virtual, physical and the spiritual world to help the user address and overcome all the negative feelings that are a result of depression. The user goes through a series of interactions that help him prevail over his loneliness, sadness, guilt, disinterest in daily activities, inability to concentrate, and the feeling of hopelessness. Various environments, including a forest where people share their depression stories around a bonfire, a virtual therapist who suggests activities to help overcome depression, an exciting canoeing encounter that helps bring back the user's interest in fun activities, a peaceful mountain environment to encourage meditation, all the while listening to soothing music and a mood reflecting sky, adds to this therapeutic experience.
