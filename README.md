# Objective

Triloka blends the three realms of the virtual, physical and the spiritual world to help the user address and overcome all the negative feelings that are a result of depression. The user goes through a series of interactions that help him prevail over his loneliness, sadness, guilt, disinterest in daily activities, inability to concentrate, and the feeling of hopelessness. Various environments, including a forest where people share their depression stories around a bonfire, a virtual therapist who suggests activities to help overcome depression, an exciting canoeing encounter that helps bring back the user's interest in fun activities, a peaceful mountain environment to encourage meditation, all the while listening to soothing music and a mood reflecting sky, adds to this therapeutic experience.

# Our Focus.

## The negative feelings faced and the way they are tackled:

<ul>
  <li> Loneliness: Meeting new people around the campfire and opening up without the fear of being judged or having preconceptions.
  <li> Sadness: Lulling soft music in the background that calms the user
  <li> Guilt: Listening to how other people overcame their depression and trying to empathize with them
  <li> Lack of Interest in daily activities: Energetic activities like canoeing that can revitalise the mind
  <li> Difficulty concentrating: Meditation session under serene conditions
  <li> Hopelessness: Motivating and engaging incentives like unlocking more environments if postive thoughts are spoken, slowly giving hope
</ul>
